# AI-Powered Question-Answering Application

## Project Description

The AI-Powered Question-Answering Application is a Spring Boot project that utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo language model to provide accurate answers to user-provided questions. GPT-3.5 Turbo is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI, capable of understanding context and generating human-like responses.

## How the Application Works

1. **Input a Question**: Users can input their questions through a user-friendly interface or API.

2. **Process the Question**: The application takes the user's question as input and processes it to prepare for the interaction with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

3. **Query the GPT-3.5 Turbo Model**: The application uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API key to query the model with the user's question, requesting a suitable answer.

4. **Receive the Answer**: GPT-3.5 Turbo processes the input question and generates a response, which is then returned to the application.

5. **Display the Answer**: The application presents the generated answer to the user, providing them with valuable information or insights.

## Project Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive and easy-to-use interface that allows users to enter their questions effortlessly.
- **API Support**: The application is designed to support API calls, enabling integration with other systems and applications.
- **Configurable AI Model**: The project uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model for question-answering, and you can specify the model key for easy customization.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.


Replace `amanastel` with your GitHub username and `your-question-answer-app` with the name of your project repository.

2. **Configure the OpenAI API Key**: Sign up for an OpenAI account and obtain your GPT-3.5 Turbo API key. Replace the placeholder for the API key in the project configuration with your actual key.

3. **Build and Run the Application**: Use Spring Boot to build and run the application on your local environment.

4. **Access the Application**: Once the application is running, access it through your web browser or make API calls to interact with it programmatically.
